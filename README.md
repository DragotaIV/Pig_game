"Pig" is a simple dice game that can be played with two or more players. The game is also sometimes called "Pass the Pigs."

To play Pig, each player takes turns rolling a pair of dice. On each turn, the player can choose to keep rolling and accumulating points, or they can stop and pass the dice to the next player. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a predetermined number of points, typically 100.

On each turn, the player rolls the dice and accumulates points based on the total value of the dice. If the player rolls a 1, they lose all their accumulated points for that turn, and their turn ends. If the player rolls a 2 through 6, they can choose to keep rolling and accumulating points or stop and add their accumulated points to their total score.

To make the game more interesting, some variations of Pig include additional rules, such as allowing players to steal points from each other, or adding special scoring bonuses for certain combinations of dice rolls.

Pig is a fun and easy game to play with friends or family, and it can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
